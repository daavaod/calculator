ToDo:
- replace eval() function
- add clear-one-character button with functionality
- submit result on enter
- better naming for functions and variables
- change operation on click - atm you can enter multiple operations in a row and alert will pop up
- add . on ui
- 

Bug:
- calculation with 0 at front is not working (e.g. 025+5)
- 12(/25) is not working
- limit keyboard character input (to be only allowed characters)
-
